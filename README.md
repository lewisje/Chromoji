Chromoji
========

This is a Google Chrome extension for Windows, OS X, and Linux that adds support
for textual emoji, based on the Unicode standard: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf
A good test page is located on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji

This `simple` branch will soon be available as a UserScript.
