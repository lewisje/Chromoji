Emoji Polyfill
========

This is a Google Chrome extension for Windows, OS X, and Linux that adds support
for textual emoji, based on the Unicode standard: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf
A good test page is located on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji

This `simple` branch is also available as a UserScript, in the fittingly named
`userscript` branch.

Go here to install the UserScript: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/8598-emoji-polyfill

Go here to install the extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoji-polyfill/kaplhmhahkanhjahbdbaamdaililfmkj

This is a fork of Chromoji by Locomojis, a Google Chrome extension that allows Chrome to
support even graphical Apple or Google style emoji; this is still useful because
Chrome for Windows still does not natively support emoji the way other browsers do, or
even the way Chrome for OS X now does.
