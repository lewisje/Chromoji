Emoji Polyfill
========

This is a UserScript that adds support for textual emoji, based on the Unicode standard: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf
A good test page is located on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji

This is a fork of Chromoji by Locomojis, a Google Chrome extension that allows Chrome to
support even graphical Apple or Google style emoji; this is still useful because
Chrome for Windows still does not natively support emoji the way other browsers do, or
even the way Chrome for OS X now does.

This UserScript will be updated so that it tries to work even in slightly older environments,
like Internet Explorer 8 and earlier using IE7Pro.
